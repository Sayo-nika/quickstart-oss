# quickstart-travis [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sayo-nika/quickstart-travis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sayo-nika/quickstart-travis)

This is a CI template to get you started on automated builds on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

Travis CI is a automated build tool to test and deploy your code. In the concept of DDLC Mods, this would
reduce your team's strain to have a dedicated builder for your team.

## Using

This is a Recipe intended to familiarize yourself on how to use Travis CI for Ren'Py applications. This way, you can code more
and worry less about releasing and packaging mods to upload it.

Take a look at `.travis.yml` to let you know on how to build mods with it!
